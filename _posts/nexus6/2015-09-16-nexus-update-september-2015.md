Back in August, Google and other ODMs made some strong commitments to start pushing out security updates more quickly and more often. The very first 30-day period following this event just occurred and we saw what we'd hoped. Google released Nexus updates right on time. Further, the Android security team started releasing public bulletins too! You can see their [August](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/android-security-updates/Ugvu3fi6RQM) and [September](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/android-security-updates/1M7qbSvACjo) bulletins at their respective locations. On the ODM side, we have seen improvements but many ODMs and carriers seem to be struggling. It's still early though, so the jury is still out. I'm sure they are all working very hard to make the necessary process improvements to meet the 30-day patch cycle.

That brings me to my next point. I don't believe security conscious people should have to compete in some random chance lottery to update their devices. In fact, I'm a huge proponent of a subscription-based or invite-only early access program for updates. I think getting fresh updates into the hands of the most savvy users would pay dividends. Even without such programs, I'm pleased to be able to assist everyone in updating their devices without having to wait for your number to come up. We'll try to do this more in the future, time permitting of course.

So... In the spirit of empowering all of you, I present the OTA links you all know and love. Sorry I didn't find the time to execute on this project sooner.

Anyway, enjoy!
