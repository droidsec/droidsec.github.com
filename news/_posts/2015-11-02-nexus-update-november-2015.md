A new month brings a new round of security patches for Nexus devices. The [November 2015 Nexus Security Bulletin](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/android-security-updates/GwZn7sixask) details the issues fixed and has been updated (as of yesterday) to include links to specific changes that fix each bug. I've updated our [AOSP Changes](http://changes.droidsec.org/) site to show all of the new changes in glorious hyperlinked diff format. Several of the disclosed issues are marked as **critical** security fixes. It's important that these fixes reach users *as quickly as possible*. In the spirit of helping that happen, we continue to deliver on our pledge to help get these updates to security conscious individuals faster. Without further ado, I present the OTA links you all know and love.

Devices older than, and including, the Nexus 4 are no longer supported. Please, for the sake of Internet security, upgrade to a newer device!

Best of luck to you and cheers to a continued focus on providing regular, timely security updates!
